## The system allows:

- Tokenization of real estate assets
- Fractional ownership through token distribution
- Asset metadata management
- Secure transfers between owners
- Centralized management through the
- RealEstateManager contract

## To get started with development:

1. You'll need to set up the TON development environment:
    - Install TON SDK
    - Set up funC compiler
    - Configure a local TON testnet

2. The contracts are ready to be compiled and deployed. You can use them to:
    - Create new tokenized real estate assets
    - Issue tokens representing fractional ownership
    - Transfer ownership between parties
    - Update asset metadata
    - Track ownership history

## Tests

Tests will help you verify that:

- The development environment is properly set up
- Contracts are deploying correctly
- Basic functionality is working as expected
- Tokenization system is functioning properly
- Asset management features are operational

To run these tests, you would:

- Compile all contracts using the funC compiler
- Deploy them to a TON testnet
- Execute the test runner script
